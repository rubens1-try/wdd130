        <p> My name is Rubenskey MERISIER, and I am 21 years old. 
            <br>I have a strong passion for sports, particularly basketball and soccer and I also enjoy singing.
            <br>Currently, I am pursuing studies in Software Development through BYU Pathway, <br>driven by a deep interest in computer science and a genuine enthusiasm for coding.
            <br>This brief introduction offers a glimpse into who I am, and I look forward to sharing more as you explore my page.
